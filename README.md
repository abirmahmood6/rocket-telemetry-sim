# Rocket Telemetry Simulator

This project simulates telemetry data from rocket sensors, including altitude, velocity, and temperature.  
The goal is to generate real-time data and log it, mimicking real rocket avionics telemetry systems.

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — runs the simulation loop  
- `sensors/virtual_sensors.py` — simulates the sensor readings
