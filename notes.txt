Notes - Consider adding factors like turbulance etc so the stimulate data looks realistic



random.uniform() - This function can be used to generate realistic values for the virtual sensors like - temperature, velocity, altitude

return round(random.uniform(100,1000),2) - gives us random value between float 100, 1000.   round(...,..., 2) makes it 2 decimal place for clean output


f'string - print(f'Rocket Altitude: {altitude} m \n' )
    f means format, {} is where variables go
    Without f', it will print everything as a string and not call in the {variable}
